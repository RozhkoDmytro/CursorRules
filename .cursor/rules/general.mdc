## Context

- Core standards for limiting or permitting AI-driven file interactions
- Ensures safe and minimal modifications

## Requirements

- Always respond in the same language as the question, but keep all code and code comments in English.  
- If crucial details are missing in the user's request, request them from the user.
- USE SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS principles.
- Run `grep_search`, `file_search`, and `list_dir` before coding.
- Never scaffold tests unless explicitly requested.
- Focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
- Both frontend user-experience and code developer-experience matter.
- Do not modify code or comments which not related to the current task.
- Keep solutions short and direct; do not rewrite entire code unless explicitly asked.
- Ask for clarification if something remains unclear.
- Never create any *.md files.
