Create a comprehensive git changes recap for the current branch compared to [BRANCH_NAME]. 

Requirements:
1. **Two languages**: Ukrainian and English versions
2. **Focus on logic and purpose**, not just file listings
3. **Explain WHY changes were made**, not WHAT was changed
4. **Include practical examples** of how to use new functionality
5. **Show key architectural decisions** with code snippets
6. **Provide usage examples** with curl commands
7. **End with a concise PR summary** highlighting new components

Structure for each language:
- 🎯 What was implemented and why (business problem solved)
- 🔍 Change logic and architectural decisions (with code examples)
- 🚀 How to use new functionality (practical examples)
- 🔧 Technical implementation details (key packages, patterns)

PR Summary should include:
- What problem this solves
- Solution approach
- Why this matters
- Key design decisions
- New key components (tables, methods, endpoints, packages)

Focus on explaining the reasoning behind changes, not just describing them.
